# Fight or Flight
## Learn your damn voicelines

I meet a lot of people playing Overwatch that don't know whether the ultimate that just got called out is friendly or not.
Blizzard put a lot of effort in the game, especially the audio clues like footsteps, weapon sounds and of course ultimate callouts are super helpful.

So do your team and yourself a favor and use this little website to learn if you should get cover or should engage the distracted enemy when somebody lets justice rain from above or tells you that it's 12 o'clock.
